# Struct Types

Struct types are a way of creating complex types that group fields of data together. They are a great way of organizing and sharing the different aspects of the data your program consumes.

- We can use the struct literal form to initialize a value from a struct type.
- The dot(.) operator allows us to access individual field values.
- We can create anonymous structs.
- No inheritance, but can use composition via [embedding](https://play.golang.org/p/GA_4_P5Ik-I).

- [Anonymous structs](https://github.com/gkjoyes/golang-tour/blob/master/lesson/02/syntax/struct-types/example2/example2.go)
- [Named and Unnamed types](https://github.com/gkjoyes/golang-tour/blob/master/lesson/02/syntax/struct-types/example3/example3.go)
- [Composition](https://github.com/gkjoyes/golang-tour/blob/master/lesson/02/syntax/struct-types/example4/example4.go)
