# Data Structures

## Data Oriented Design

> Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. - Rob Pike

Design Philosophy:

- If you don't understand the data, you don't understand the problem.
- All problems are unique and specific to the data you are working with.
- Data transformations are at the heart of solving problems. Each function, method and work-flow must focus on implementing the specific data transformations required to solve the problems.
- If your data is changing, your problems are changing. When your problems are changing, the data transformation needs to change with it.
- Uncertainty about the data is not a licence to guess but a directive to STOP and learn more.
- Solving problems you don't have creates more problems you now do.
- If performance matters, you must have mechanical sympathy for how the hardware and operating system work.
- Minimize, simplify and reduce the amount of code required to solve each problem. Do less work by not wasting effort.
- Code that can be reasoned about and does not hide execution costs can be better understood, debugged, and performance-tuned.
- Coupling data together and writing code that produces predictable access patterns to the data will be the most performant.
- Changing data layouts can yield more significant performance improvements than changing just the algorithms.
- Efficiency is obtained through algorithms but performance is obtained through data structures and layouts.
