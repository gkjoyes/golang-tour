# Arrays

Arrays are a special data structure in Go that allows us to allocate contiguous blocks of fixed size memory.

- Arrays are fixed length data structures that can't change.
- Arrays of different sizes are considered to be of different types.
- Collection of items with same type.
- Memory is allocated as a contiguous block.
- Copies refer to different underlying data.
- Access via zero-based index.
