# Slices

Slices are incredibly important data structure in Go. They form the basis for how we manage and manipulate data in a flexible, performant and dynamic way. It is incredibly important for all Go programmers to learn how to uses slices.

- Slices are like dynamic arrays with special and built-in functionality.
- There is a difference between the length and capacity of a slice and they each serve a purpose.
- Slices allow for multiple views of the same underlying array.
- Slices can grow through the use of the built-in function append.
