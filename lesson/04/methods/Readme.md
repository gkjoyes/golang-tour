# Methods

Methods are functions that give data the ability to exhibit the behaviour.

- Methods are functions that declare a receiver variable.
- Receivers bind a method to a type and use value or pointer sematic.
- Value semantic means a copy of the value is passed across program boundaries.
- Pointer semantic means a copy of the address of the value is passed across program boundaries.
- Stick to a single semantic for a given type and be consistent.
